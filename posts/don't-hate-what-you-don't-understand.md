# why I hated Javacript

Back in 2018 When I Started Learning Javascript in my first year of BTS (Brevet de Technicien Sup√©rieur it is 2 years diploma), After we studied Html and CSS , we started learning Javascript, I hated it so much because of the way our teacher explained it and in that time I wasn't self-taught, all my knowledge comes from my teachers.
and the way we used to write scripts was complicated, and we didn't use Ecmascript,I passed to second year when we studied PHP and MySQL, in that time i thought that i'll not be in need Javascript anymore, cause all I only know of javascript is how to validate form or some few things that i'll naver face in programming, for example if i want to validate form i can do it in back end with PHP.

After I graduated from BTS in the summer of 2019. I was confused between learning Laravel or mastering the Front end, I watched a lot of videos on youtube, saw twits on Twitter, reading some articles, and listening to podcasts about how powerful javascript is, and how you can use it for everything from the front end to the back end, Desktop and Mobile. then I knew I should learn it whatever it takes.

# How I study

In The summer of 2019, I decided to start learning javascript from scratch, I started learning CSS also, then I moved to Javascript, in that period of time when I have built some landing pages, a simple calculator, surface converter, etc. Then I started learning React Js, I built my portfolio using it, now I replaced with NESXTJS, after learning REACTJS and building some projects using it, like Image gallery, recipes app, Github users finder, and e-commerce using react for the front end and Laravel for the back end, I developed a small React native application, then I started learning Express js, and I built a back end API named Pet Store,you can check my projects [https://github.com/oubani](https://github.com/oubani).
